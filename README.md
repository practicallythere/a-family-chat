# A Family Chat

### About this project
These files exist as part of work created while participating on the Publishing Platforms as part of the Communication Design MA course at the University of Reading.

This project explores the possibility of saving online chat conversations with a focus on print typesetting. As part of a hybrid publishing process, the paginated document is also available online as a PDF, hosted here on GitHub. As well as a PDF, this repository also contains information about the HTML markup and CSS stylesheets required to undertake a similar project.

####index.html
This file contains the markup templates to be populated with the chat data.

####CSS
This file contains the CSS files linked in index.html. There is a main CSS file, CSS files for only or image styles respectively, and a file containing styles that a JS file adds after Paged.js has finished loading.

####JS
This file contains javascript files required for the project. One is the configuration file for the average colour plugin; the other applies a CSS file once Paged.js has finished working.

####Dependencies
This project requires Paged.js and the Fast Average Color plugin, both of which are linked in index.html. Index.html must be viewed in a server environment such as MAMP for these to work.
