# A Family Chat

### About this project
These files exist as part of work created while participating on the Publishing Platforms as part of the Communication Design MA course at the University of Reading.

This project explores the possibility of saving online chat conversations with a focus on print typesetting. As part of a hybrid publishing process, the paginated document is also available online as a PDF, hosted here on GitHub. As well as a PDF, this repository also contains information about the HTML markup and CSS stylesheets required to undertake a similar project.
